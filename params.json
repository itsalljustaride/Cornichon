{"name":"Cornichon","tagline":"A Feedback Interface for the DiLL System","body":"## About\r\n***\r\nCornichon is an alternative or additional web front-end for the DiLL lab system that provides feedback and review functionality, and was developed at the University of Michigan and Grand Valley State University. Cornichon is not supported by or otherwise associated with Northwestern University or DiLL. All support requests should be directed through this project's Git repository at http://github.com/itsalljustaride/Cornichon or at the project page at http://www.itsalljustaride.com/?page_id=295\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n***\r\nCornichon is a Ruby on Rails app, and as such it requires a bit more setup than, for instance, a PHP app might. It is assumed that anyone installing Cornichon will have a Mac OSX based server, as that is what DiLL itself operates on. The good news is that OSX comes with many of the components necessary to run Cornichon out of the box.\r\n\r\nSetup procedure:\r\n\r\nInstall Git: http://git-scm.com/\r\nClone from Git: git clone git://github.com/itsalljustaride/Cornichon.git\r\n\r\nMake sure Postgres is in PATH ($which postgres - should output location)\r\n\r\nInstall required gems: sudo rake gems:install\r\nIf pg gem fails, make sure ARCHFLAGS is set depending on 32 or 64 bit\r\nBoth PostgreSQL and Ruby must be running the same architecture (32 or 64-bit). A mismatch will cause the Ruby pg gem to fail to install.\r\n\r\nSet up passenger as gem describes (sudo gem install passenger).\r\nEdit httpd.conf and virtual host passenger prefs to point to webserver/documents\r\n\r\nCopy config/database.yml.default to config/database.yml and edit with your info\r\nCreate the production database: sudo rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production\r\nRun rake migration: sudo rake db:migrate\r\n\r\nrun to test: ./script/server\r\nIf can access at localhost:3000 we can proceed with setting up apache\r\n\r\nIf everything is good, run: sudo apachectl graceful\r\nThis will refresh Apache and you should see Cornichon running at http://servername/cornichon\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n***\r\nCOPYRIGHT  2010 GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\r\n \r\nPERMISSION IS GRANTED TO USE, COPY, AND CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF THIS SOFTWARE FOR NONCOMMERCIAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH PURPOSES, SO LONG AS NO FEE IS CHARGED, AND SO LONG AS THE COPYRIGHT NOTICE ABOVE, THIS GRANT OF PERMISSION, AND THE DISCLAIMER BELOW APPEAR IN ALL COPIES MADE; AND SO LONG AS THE NAME OF NEITHER THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN NOR GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY ARE USED IN ANY ADVERTISING OR PUBLICITY PERTAINING TO THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE WITHOUT SPECIFIC, WRITTEN PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.\r\n \r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITHOUT REPRESENTATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OR GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY AS TO ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OR GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
