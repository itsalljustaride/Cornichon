About
____________________
Cornichon is an alternative or additional web front-end for the DiLL lab system that provides feedback and review functionality, and was developed at the University of Michigan and Grand Valley State University. Cornichon is not supported by or otherwise associated with Northwestern University or DiLL. All support requests should be directed through this project's Git repository at http://github.com/itsalljustaride/Cornichon or at the project page at http://www.itsalljustaride.com/?page_id=295


Installation
____________________
Cornichon is a Ruby on Rails app, and as such it requires a bit more setup than, for instance, a PHP app might. It is assumed that anyone installing Cornichon will have a Mac OSX based server, as that is what DiLL itself operates on. The good news is that OSX comes with many of the components necessary to run Cornichon out of the box.

Setup procedure:

Install Git: http://git-scm.com/
Clone from Git: git clone git://github.com/itsalljustaride/Cornichon.git

Make sure Postgres is in PATH ($which postgres - should output location)

Install required gems: sudo rake gems:install
If pg gem fails, make sure ARCHFLAGS is set depending on 32 or 64 bit

Set up passenger as gem describes (sudo gem install passenger).
Edit httpd.conf and virtual host passenger prefs to point to webserver/documents

Copy config/database.yml.default to config/database.yml and edit with your info
Create the production database: sudo rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production
Run rake migration: sudo rake db:migrate

run to test: ./script/server
If can access at localhost:3000 we can proceed with setting up apache

If everything is good, run: sudo apachectl graceful
This will refresh Apache and you should see Cornichon running at http://servername/cornichon
